2. Front-end
mandatory

For this task, start by making a copy of your task1 directory and name it task2. We have created a very simple API server with one route that returns “Hello, World!” and now we want to create a web page to view content from our API server in the context of a more full front-end. Before creating our front end, let’s reorganize this project a bit in our task2 directory.

- Create a new directory named back-end inside of your task2 directory.
- Move all of the files currently in task2 inside of the new back-end directory.

You should have api.py and Dockerfile inside of your new ```task2/back-end``` directory.

- Create a new ```task2/front-end``` directory
- Inside your new task2/front-end, clone this repository -> https://github.com/atlas-school/softy-pinko-front-end

With the softy-pinko-front-end directory and files in place, we need to create a new Dockerfile in your task2/front-end directory. In order to host and distribute our front-end content we will use a static web server named Nginx; there are many others that can be used, but this one is rather simple to get started with and conveniently has a Docker image that we can use which is pre-installed.

- In the new task2/front-end/Dockerfile, instead of using the latest ubuntu version, use the latest version of nginx.
- Your softy-pinko-front-end files must be copied to /var/www/html/softy-pinko-front-end on the Docker image.
- Create an Nginx config file named softy-pinko-front-end.conf inside of the task2/front-end directory. This file must be copied to the Docker image to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf and must include all of the configuration settings required to get your site to show up when visiting the URL.

When researching Nginx config files, the only section you’ll need in the softy-pinko-front-end.conf file is the “server” section. Pay attention to the syntax used to set up a port to listen to (recommendation: port 9000), the name of the server, the location, and the index file to use.

```softy-pinko-front-end.conf```
```
server {
// Replace with your Nginx server configuration
}
```

At the end of this process, you should have a front end that is accessible like the following:
